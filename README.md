# Multi-Receiver-Anonymous-Singcryption-for-Crowdsourced-IoMT-Environment
1.Describtion
This is the code for the paper named Multi-Receiver Anonymous Singcryption for Crowdsourced IoMT Environment. The code use the [Pypbc Library](https://github.com/debatem1/pypbc), which is the extension of [PBC Library](https://github.com/blynn/pbc). Meanwhile, the elliptic curve used in our scheme is the type f curve in PBC Library.

2.Code Running
An example: python main.py --t=2 --n=10 --num=5 --theta=1 <br>
Attribute number: t <br>
real receiver number: n <br>
max receiver number: num <br>
Attribute discolse number: theta <br>
Restriction: theta<=t and num<=n <br>
